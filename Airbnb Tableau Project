This is a project I have created by using 2016 airbnb data from Seattle in order to help a friend determine the most profitable home to buy and rent. I used the data to create charts 
comparing the average price of rentals per bedrooms, the zipcodes and average price of rentals within those zipcodes, the competition for rentals per bedroom, as well as when to rent 
out their airbnb depending on the time of year.
